Development Notes
IDE File (WindowObject.ide.js)
Defines:

Widget properties (URL, opened flag)

Services (OpenWindow, CloseWindow)

Mashup display name and description

Correct structure: services are not defined inside properties â€” they are declared in their own services object returned from widgetProperties().

Runtime File (WindowObject.runtime.js)
Implements:

OpenWindow() â†’ Opens a new window and sets opened = true

CloseWindow() â†’ Closes the window and sets opened = false

Handles Mashup service invocations via serviceInvoked(serviceName).
